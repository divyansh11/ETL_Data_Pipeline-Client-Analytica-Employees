Problem Statement

In response to stringent data privacy regulations and the need for secure analytics, we are tasked with developing a comprehensive data pipeline for Analytica-Employees. This involves extracting employee data from multiple sources, applying robust data masking techniques to safeguard sensitive information, and loading the transformed data securely into Google BigQuery. Additionally, our objective is to create an intuitive dashboard using tools like Google Data Studio or Tableau for visualizing the anonymized data, ensuring compliance and enabling informed decision-making.

Industry Context

In today's regulatory environment, organizations face increasing challenges in managing and protecting sensitive employee data. Compliance with global data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA is critical to maintaining trust and avoiding legal repercussions.

Project Objectives

1. Data Extraction: Consolidate employee data from diverse sources including databases, CSV files, and APIs to ensure comprehensive data capture.
2. Data Masking: Implement advanced techniques to anonymize sensitive employee information such as personal identifiers and financial details, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
3. Data Loading into BigQuery: Establish a secure process for loading masked employee data into Google BigQuery, leveraging its scalability and analytics capabilities.
